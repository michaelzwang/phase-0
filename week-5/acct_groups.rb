# Pseudocode
# => Input: array of people
# => Output: arrays with 4 or 5 people
# => determine length of array (number of people in cohort)
# => determine how many groups are needed
# => create new arrays for the groups
# => add members to the groups
# => return the group arrays

#Initial Solution
def acct_groups(array)
    if array.length % 5 != 0
        num_groups = array.length/5 + 1
    end
    
    cohort = array.shuffle
    groups = Array.new(num_groups) {[]}
    
    groups.each do |group|
       5.times do 
           group << cohort.pop
       end
    end
    
    return groups
end


#Refactored Solution
def acct_groups(array)
    groups = array.shuffle.each_slice(5).to_a
    
    until groups.last.length > 3
    	groups.last << groups.sample.pop
    end

    count = 1
    groups.each do |group|
        puts "Group" + count.to_s + ": " + group.join(", ") 
        count += 1
    end
end

#Reflection
#What was the most interesting and most difficult part of this challenge?
# => It was interesting because it was a real life applicable challenge. It was difficult to figure out a way to split one big array into smaller groups.
#Do you feel you are improving in your ability to write pseudocode and break the problem down?
# => I think I need to remember to go back to my pseudocode when I get stuck. I find that I kind of just move on from my pseudocode when I'm coding.
#Was your approach for automating this task a good solution? What could have made it even better?
# => I think my approach is a good solution. I think it could be improved by finding a simpler way to divide the groups evenly (like all groups of 5 but two groups of 4)
#What data structure did you decide to store the accountability groups in and why?
# => I used arrays because there was no key/value pair.
#What did you learn in the process of refactoring your initial solution? Did you learn any new Ruby methods?
# => I learned about the each_slice method to efficiently split a large array into smaller arrays. I also was able to add some style to the printed out list of groups.
