###What is an integer? What is a float?

An integer is a number without a decimal point.
A float or floating-point number is a number with decimal points. 

###What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?

During integer division, you will only get integer answers. If the answer is not an integer, the computer will round down to the nearest integer. 

During float division, you will get the float answer (a number with a decimal).

###Hours in a year. How many hours are in a year?

###How does Ruby handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of numbers?

Ruby handles numbers in basic arithmetic the way you would expect. The only difference is that ruby treats integers and floats differently. 

###What are strings? Why and when would you use them?

Strings are groups of letters. They are surrounded by quotation marks. You would use strings when you want to give something a name or value that isn't a number. 

###What are local variables? Why and when would you use them?

Local variable are variable that live inside the method. You would use them because they allow you to define a variable that can only be used within the scope where it was defined.

###How was this challenge? Did you get a good review of some of the basics?

This was a nice and simple challenge and got me familiar with using ruby files and rspec in the command line.
