###Describe what open source means.

Open source software is the practice of sharing how a computer program was made and allowing anyone to customize the program as they see fit. The code is freely distributed and the source code must be included. 

###What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?

I think that open source is good in that it encourages collaboration and gives everyone access to a variety of different programs. 

###Assess the importance of using licenses.

Using licesnses is very important because it gives credit to the original creator. Open-source lincensing allows the orginal creator to hold the original copyright but also allows others to contribute to a project without having to seek special permission.
