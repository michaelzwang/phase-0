# 1.1 Think About Time Reflection

A couple time management and productivity ideas I learned about are the Pomodoro technique and meditation. I found the Pomodoro technique interesting because other than splitting work into 25 minute increments, the technique encourages you to monitor how many Pomodoro increments are needed to complete specific tasks. I also thought it was very interesting to see the fMRI scans of the brain before and after meditation that show how the brain is directly affected by meditation.

Time Boxing is a technique where an individual or a team predetermines a time frame. By the end of the time frame, if the work is not completed, time is taken to evaluate the work that has been done so far. This technique can be used in Phase 0 by making sure to take time to review work even if it's not completed yet. 

Currently, I manage time by setting short-term goals and taking breaks in-between each goal. I think that this works for me because it prevents me from being overwhelmed by the workload and the breaks can be used to take my mind off things. I also make sure to take time to eat well and go to the gym. I find that maintaining a certain routine and taking time for health can help with mental health as well. I think that I will continue these strategies for Phase 0. 

# 1.2 The Command Line Reflection

A shell is an environment in where we can run commands, programs, and scripts. Bash is a basic shell that comes built into the computer. The most challenging thing was understanding the path that occurred with each command, but after going over them, I was able to execute all the commands. I think that the most important ones to know are man and apropos because with those, you can figure out which command to use next.

pwd prints the working directory. ls lists the directory. mv moves a file or directory. cd changes the directory. ../ moves up a directory. touch makes empty files. mkdir makes a new directory. less pages through a file. rmdir removes a directory. rm removes a file. help displays a list of commands.
