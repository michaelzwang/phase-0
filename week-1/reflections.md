# 1.1 Think About Time Reflection

A couple time management and productivity ideas I learned about are the Pomodoro technique and meditation. I found the Pomodoro technique interesting because other than splitting work into 25 minute increments, the technique encourages you to monitor how many Pomodoro increments are needed to complete specific tasks. I also thought it was very interesting to see the fMRI scans of the brain before and after meditation that show how the brain is directly affected by meditation.

Time Boxing is a technique where an individual or a team predetermines a time frame. By the end of the time frame, if the work is not completed, time is taken to evaluate the work that has been done so far. This technique can be used in Phase 0 by making sure to take time to review work even if it's not completed yet. 

Currently, I manage time by setting short-term goals and taking breaks in-between each goal. I think that this works for me because it prevents me from being overwhelmed by the workload and the breaks can be used to take my mind off things. I also make sure to take time to eat well and go to the gym. I find that maintaining a certain routine and taking time for health can help with mental health as well. I think that I will continue these strategies for Phase 0. 

# 1.2 The Command Line Reflection

A shell is an environment in where we can run commands, programs, and scripts. Bash is a basic shell that comes built into the computer. The most challenging thing was understanding the path that occurred with each command, but after going over them, I was able to execute all the commands. I think that the most important ones to know are man and apropos because with those, you can figure out which command to use next.

pwd prints the working directory. ls lists the directory. mv moves a file or directory. cd changes the directory. ../ moves up a directory. touch makes empty files. mkdir makes a new directory. less pages through a file. rmdir removes a directory. rm removes a file. help displays a list of commands.

# 1.4 Forking and Cloning Reflection

To create a new repository on Github, login to your Github account, click the plus sign in the top righthand corner, and click "new repository." Give the repository a name and fill in the remaining information as desired before clicking "create repository."

To fork a repo, go to the desired repository, click "fork" in the top righthand corner, and select your username.

To clone a repo, open your terminal and enter your desired directory. Then, on Github, go to the repo that you want to clone and copy the URL under SSH/HTTPS. In the terminal, type "git clone COPIED_URL." You might be prompted to type in your Github username and password. Press enter and your repo will be cloned into the directory.

Forking a repository is useful because it creates an exact copy of a repository that you can now edit without changing the original repository. This is useful when collaborating and dealing with large repositories.
