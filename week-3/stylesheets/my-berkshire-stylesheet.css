/*
What is important to know when linking an external file (like a stylesheet) to an HTML file?
it is important to know the pathways to the stylesheet.

What tricks did you use to help you with positioning? 
We created a border to help visualize what would change if we changed the margin or padding. We also used floats, display inline and relative positioning. 

How hard was it to get the site as you wanted it?
The general format was straight-forward. The difficult part was adding an image and positioning it the way we wanted.

What CSS did you use to modify the element style (like size, color, etc.)
We used font-size, color, text-align.

Did you modify the HTML to include classes or ids? If so, which did you choose and why? 
If you didn't, how would you know which one to add to your HTML?

We mostly used classes because we wanted to group certain elements together. We used ids in the beginning to format a single element.

When you compared your site to the actual code base, which do you think had cleaner code that followed best practices and why?

I think ours was cleaner because we didn't use a table to format the text. Also, we used a separate stylesheet while the actual site used styling in the html file.
