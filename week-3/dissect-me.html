<p>As the year draws to a close, I am excited to start this new journey into the world of computer programing. This week I began by learning how to use the command line, Git and GitHub.</p>

<p>The main takeway from this week was learning the difference between Git and GitHub. The two terms had always been confusing to me, so I was glad that I had the time to finally distinguish them from each other. It turns out that Git is softwarre that you install on your computer that provides a history of content changes. This ability to keep track of all changes made to a file and the option to revert back to a previous version of the file is called version control. Version control is useful because it allows the user to go back to a save point to revise code in case of bugs. Additionally, it facilitates collaborative changes to a file by allowing multiple users to work on their own copy before merging the changes.</p>

<p>GitHub is a cool invention where you can store and access your work online. It allows you to host and share your code with others, and allows others to offer feedback and suggestions to your code. GitHub is a great collaboration tool that works in sync with Git.</p>

<p>The thing that surprised me the most was that I can use the command line to directly upload my work online to GitHub. For me, this was a new concept that I had to wrap my head around. Overall, I found it really fun to be able to create new files and directories and send them over to my repositories on GitHub.</p>

1. What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?

We got a lot of practice using the <html> tag, especially in creating a snippit for it. Additionally, we used the <body> tag and the <p> tag for all the content.

2. How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?

Elements are laid out in a hierarchy. There's the head and body and then within each can be different sections like the header, nav, article, and footer.

3. What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?

I definitely learned more about snippets. I was wondering how sublime knew to add the basic html structure! It was cool to make a new snippet and customize what we wanted to add to it. I think it will be really useful in the future because it can save a lot of time and make sure small errors aren't made.
