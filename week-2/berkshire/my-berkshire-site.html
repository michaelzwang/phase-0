<!-- 
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
HTML seemed more intuitive to learn because it was more concrete and less abstract like git and the command line. HTML follows a very logical order where what you type is what you will see on the webpage. This made it easier to learn and understand.

- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
Looked up how to make a horizontal line. The only other thing to look up was how to make something bold. 

- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
It was relatively easy to not use formatting in HTML since neither of us had prior experience with HTML.

- What seems good and bad about HTML?
HTML is good because it provides the structure for the site and is intuitive and easier to understand. It's bad because it is limited in scope. It only can provide text, links, and images and basic formatting. 

- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
Always to remember the DOCTYPE and html tags. The rest, like head, body, title tags remind me of writing an essay on a word document.
