###What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?

It will be a professional website to share my work history, background, projects, link to my blog, and contact information(including links to social networks).

###What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?

The target audience's interests are in my past and current work and projects. The site addresses these interests by providing information about my work history and projects. Additionally, if the audience would like to contact me based on my work, the website will provide them with the necessary information.

###What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.

The primary action is to see my portfolio and then contact me.

###What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?

User experience (UX) is how a persion feels when interfacing with a system. This includes ease of use, perception of value, utility, and efficiency. 

###What is user experience design and why is it valuable? 

User experience design is the process of enhancing user satisfaction by improving the usability, accessibility, and pleasure when using the system. It is valuable because a greater UX will be more effective and be more accessible to users across multiple platforms.
